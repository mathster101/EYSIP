We got this GPS for my husband who is an (OTR) over the road trucker.  Very Impressed with the shipping time, it arrived a few days earlier than expected...  within a week of use however it started freezing up... could of just been a glitch in that unit.  Worked great when it worked!  Will work great for the normal person as well but does have the "trucker" option. (the big truck routes - tells you when a scale is coming up ect...)  Love the bigger screen, the ease of use, the ease of putting addresses into memory.  Nothing really bad to say about the unit with the exception of it freezing which is probably one in a million and that's just my luck.  I contacted the seller and within minutes of my email I received a email back with instructions for an exchange! VERY impressed all the way around!,electronics
I'm a professional OTR truck driver, and I bought a TND 700 at a truck stop hoping to make my life easier.  Rand McNally, are you listening?First thing I did after charging it was connect it to my laptop and install the software and then attempt to update it.  The software detected a problem with my update and wanted my home address so I could be sent a patch on an SD card.  Hello?  I don't think I'm all that unusual; my home address is a PO box that a friend checks weekly and that I might get to check every six months or so.  I live in my truck and at truck stops.  If you need to make a patch available on an SD card then you should send the SD cards to the truck stops where the devices are sold.  I ran the update program multiple times until the program said that the TND 700 was completely updated.I programmed in the height (13'6"), the length (53') and the weight (80,000#) of my rig and told it that I preferred highways.  I was parked at a truck stop in the Cincinnati OH area.  My next pickup was about 15 miles down the same freeway but on the other side of it a couple of blocks.  My cell phone GPS (Sprint) said to get on the freeway to get to my pickup.  The TND 700 routed me thru 23 miles of residential streets before finally getting me to my pickup.  Very exciting, especially since every time I refused to turn down a street posted "No Trucks" the TND 700 took almost 5 minutes to figure a re-route, and it happened multiple times on that short trip.I decided to give it another chance.  After my pickup on the north side of Cincinnati just off of I-75 I needed to head to Phoenix AZ via I-71.  Easy route is to just hop on I-75 and drive west and south to the intersection of I-71.  Indeed, that is what my cell phone advised.  The TND 700, however, wanted to route me over surface streets across the city and pick up I-75 on the other side of the city.  I turned it off and the next time I passed a truck stop of the same chain I purchased it at I returned it and got my money back.I then spent $30 on a cheap printer.  Now I take a minute to set up my route on Google and print it out.  Hasn't gotten me lost yet over several cross country trips.,electronics
Well, what can I say.  I've had this unit in my truck for about four days now.  Prior to that I had a Garmin 755T non-truck GPS.  One of my favorite features in that unit was the ability to plan a route by determining mileage using the stop or via feature.  What I would do is using a map I would route myself several different ways forcing the unit by putting in stops or vias at different locations along the route, otherwise, like most GPS 's, it determines what it thinks is the best route.  I could add up to 10 Via's or stop points for each route and then based on mileage and other factors determine which is the best route to take.  Multiple stops and the ability to route was the most important reason for having the Garmin.  However it was not truck specific.  And considering I am now hauling strictly hazmat I wanted something that would take that into consideration.  After perusing various forums, review sites, and word-of-mouth my choices boiled down to the Garmin 465T or the RAND McNally Intelliroute TND 700.  Even though it was quite a bit more than the Garmin I chose the TND 700 for several reasons.  The main one being the extra screen size, and its ability to coordinate with the RAND McNally truck atlas and also its ease of updating.Now on to my first impression of the TND 700.  It seems to be an aesthetically pleasing and durably built unit.  The first thing I noticed was it's very slow to boot compared to my old Garmin.  Whether this is unique to the TND 700 or is common amongst all truck specific gps units I cannot tell, but it's really not that big of a deal.  The second thing I noticed was the overwhelming wealth of information put forth.  That might explain why the manual (available via the TND dock) is well over 100 pages long.....  There is somewhat of a learning curve with this unit.  The next thing I noticed was the complexity of entering routes.  As previously mentioned I like to force it into my preferred routing by the use of stops or vias.  That was a big no go with this unit.  While you can enter multiple stops or vias it is nowhere near as user-friendly as my old Garmin.  Furthermore there is no way you can determine total mileage on the route that you have chosen, as I could with the Garmin.  Totally flummoxed by what appeared to be an omission of one of the best routing tools a trucker could have I went online and verified through an expert source connected with RAND McNally that no, that feature was a couple updates down the line and was not available at this point.  Unbelievable.  Also forcing the unit to follow a specific route can be very challenging.  For a unit of this price, and feature laden, I find this totally unacceptable.  I am still mulling over selling this unit  and buying the Garmin 465T.  I really do like this GPS, the screen is magnificent, and the volume is awesome.Another thing I've noticed, which I do not think is unique to this unit, is some of the weird routing that it does.  I've never owned a truck specific GPS before but after playing with this one for a couple of days I get the impression that what RAND MacNally (and the others that use Navteq) has done is take a plain old car specific Navteq map and a road atlas with truck restrictions and made notifications on the map.  In most databases there is not a 100% thorough listing of every road in the country.  What I mean is that this unit will route you down roads you don't belong on.  Today while coming home it tried routing me on several  9 ton County roads.  What that means is that a truck is limited to 73280 unless the road is posted at 10 tons.  County roads do not have that restriction listed in the RAND McNally road atlas, so I believe that is why it is not listed.....  Also unacceptable in a unit of this price and sold as truck specific.  However I'd be willing to bet the other truck specific units are the same way as no one has ever done a truck specific version of NavTeq.Another bone I have to pick is the POI's. Not only the truck specific ones but the others all seem to be somewhat outdated.  I think the Garmin, at least the ones that I have used, are more current.  It would also be nice if I could add my own POI'sTo sum it up I will keep this unit a little longer to see if I can make it workable.  If not I will go back to Garmin.  I like the concept and I like the unit but at this point I'll have to say I am somewhat unimpressed.pros:Large screenterrific imagesoutstanding volumecons:inability to determine route mileage by multiple stops and viasa somewhat outdated POI information.Non-truck specific routings.Cost.,electronics
Not going to write a long review, even thought this unit deserves one. I've driven well over 1-mil miles and done most of my own routing so I pretty know whats the fastest and shortest. Have been using a basic garmin for the past three years and with ANY Gps unit they'll ALL get you in trouble if you let them. I was really excited about this unit, due to the size and the features. Allot of great grafics and on screen info thats usefull. But the most basic item that it was lacking was the gps tracking. I gave this unit allot of leadway on its mistakes due to the fact that it had allot of cool stuff that it did, but its ability to track you and route you was not even close to what the basic garmin could due. Its like the prossesor that they installed in the TND 700 was 10 years old. Example if I needed to make a simple route change I.E. in town down to the next street due to the fact that I couldn't make the turn or the street was blocked off, it would take the TND 700 upwards of 45 seconds to a minute and a half to reroute me. Here I'm sitting at a stop light waiting for directions and waiting that long with cars on my backside didn't make me happy. This is a problem that happened evertime you had to reroute, weather it was a simple street change or a major highway change. Also from the time you turned the unit on it would take twice as long to boot itself up. At least a dozen times with in a week it put me on the wrong roads and when I made a wrong turn it got it self lost....I.E. take left on xyz street, and it was some ones drive way. Or turn left in 800 yards and the turn was less than 10 feet away. You might think in a conjested city situation I might get a little mixed up, but this is out in the country. Twice it put me under 12'6" bridges when I'm 13'6". Of course I made sure all my truck setting where they were supposed to be. I also updated the OS version,via Rand McNally. All in all I expected alot out of this unit and got a unit that should of been field tested with some people that drive allot. It just had to many route mistakes. Going back to the basic garmin. This isn't just my complaints, I have three friends that bought the same unit and have the same complaints. All of us returned the units.,electronics
I've had mine for a year and here's what we got. It tries to route be down non truck routes while telling me the truck route is illegal for me. This is such a bad problem that even Interstate 25 in Denver Colorado is listed (according to this GPS) as a non- truck route and will route you through the city instead. There are several drivers within our company who own one and more than half (of about 50) have crashed to an un-recoverable state. Our company representative said that Rand McNally informed them that the GPS was not designed to say on for a long period of time. Really? it's a truck driver GPS. We have one driver with a $2400 dollar ticket due to this GPS routing him down the wrong road. The companies response was to update the unit. I've had mine for a year, I never noticed one update that corrected functionality, they only seem to keep messing the tools. I want a GPS that routes, if I wanted tools I'd buy software for my computer.My suggestion is to by a nice Garmen. My one rated for cars actually routes me better than this one rated for trucks.Wayne,electronics
I am using this with a Nook HD+. It works as described. The HD picture on my Samsung 52&#34; TV is excellent.,electronics
The cable is very wobbly and sometimes disconnects itself.The price is completely unfair and only works with the Nook HD and HD+,electronics
This adaptor is real easy to setup and use right out of the box. I had not problem with it at all, it is well worth the purchase. I recommend this adaptor very much for viewing your Nook videos on your HDTV. I just disagree with other reviews on the length of the adaptor, I found it to be fairly adequate as to how and where it is connected to my TV. For me it was just right not too long or too short, I was able to place my Nook right below the connection on the TV stand, it did not fall or anything else, it is fine. Use your own judgement, I'm too busy watching my movies :),electronics
This adapter easily connects my Nook HD 7&#34; to my HDTV through the HDMI cable.  This is good for traveling because it makes any hotel TV a potential smart TV so long as there is an accessible HDMI port.  It is also good for sharing photos from FB on a bigger screen. A bit pricey, but a good accessory to have.  Be sure to note that this is ONLY for the Nook HD and HD+ series.  It will not work with a standard Nook.,electronics
This product really works great but I found the following items you need to keep in mind:- You must have your power adapter connected for it to work...it plugs in the the bottom. It appears it needs power from the nook power adapter to operate.- The plug fits in loosely and you cannot move the Nook around much without holding the adapter in place.- On initial plugin it seems you need to rock it around to get the connection but then it seems solid.- It works with a 25ft high quality HDMI cable so you can put the NOOK across the room with you. Not tested with cheap cables.Warning...I found that my LG SmartTV 3D from a few years back does not work with this adapter but it does not seem to work with many things...bad software. This adapter works fine with other HDMI devices I have used like monitors and I am sure other TVs.Gave it five stars because it really is nice to extend the screen and use your Nook as a streaming server to your TV. Nice they made such a device.,electronics
My daughter wanted this book and the price on Amazon was the best.  She has already tried one recipe a day after receiving the book.  She seems happy with it.,home
I bought this zoku quick pop for my daughterr with her zoku quick maker. She loves it and have fun to make her own ice cream.,home
There is no shortage of pop recipes available for free on the web, but I purchased the "Zoku Quick Pops" book, because Zoku has some good recipes for fruit pops on its blog. I was hoping there were more where those came from. This book emphasizes very sweet dessert pops, however. There are 41 recipes in total, only 13 of which are fruit pops. There is a "Fresh and Fruity" chapter, followed by three chapters of dessert pops entitled "I Scream for Quick Pops!", "Bake Shop", and  "Coco Loco". As you might guess from the last one, there are 15 pop recipes that contain chocolate.Chapters on "Tips" and "Techniques" are useful. There is more detailed information about ingredients that don't freeze well in the Zoku than is found in the instruction manual. The book lists options for dairy products and sweeteners, tells you how to do different types of layers, how to add decorative fruit slices, how to do a quick shell, and how to make core pops. The pages about core pops are especially helpful, as they include recipes for pink, purple, and orange outer layers for brightly-colored core pops. The book recommends using Zoku accessory kits, but you can do without.The pop recipes tend to go out of their way to be as sweet as possible. Many, including the recipe for a vanilla base, call for vanilla pudding, where vanilla Greek yogurt would do just as well. I've substituted it with no ill effect. On the bright side, many of these recipes may appeal to children, whereas most pop books that I have seen are geared more to adults. There are flavors like "Cookie Dough", "That's a S'more", chocolate peanut butter, and peanut butter and jelly. All 9 recipes in "Bake Shop" are inspired by cake and cookie recipes.As a resource for light, fresh-tasting fruit pop recipes, "Zoku Quick Pops" is very limited. Most of the fruit recipes are gimmicky and contain too many ingredients. The recipe for Lemonade pops contains orange juice, which is fine, but the addition of vanilla extract kills the fresh fruit flavor. The recipe for mango pops includes orange, apple, banana and lemon, which are too many competing flavors. Mango and orange together make a terrific pop. The book is great for chocolate lovers and those looking for dessert pop recipes. Tips and techniques are also useful. For fruit pop recipes, "Top Pops" by Emily Zaiden is far better.,home
This book is a must have if you get a Zoku (which I also highly recommend). There is a large variety of recipes from simple, to fancy. The flavor combos are creative, and it gives you ideas for decorating the pops too. They turn out as beautiful as they are tasty. After reading it you will be inspired to create your own recipes too.,home
This cookbook is great.  I have really enjoyed reviewing all of the recipes.  Sure - some are more difficult than others, but there is a nice variety in this book.  For me it was totally worth it just to get the quick shell recipes alone.  We have only tried the chocolate so far, but it is so tasty.  A few of my favorite recipes in this book are the banana from the strawberry banana one, and the raspberry/blackberry ones (but I used mixed berries).  Also, it has great instructions for tips on using the Zoku.  Definitely recommended.,home
If you have a Zoku Quick Pop maker (or two....I have the original one-slot and then I bought the double-slot here at Amazon), I recommend you get this creative little book, which will inspire you.,home
This book is so beautifully illustrated and easy to follow. It helps you to understand the Zoku better. It might have been even better if they made the recipe units for different sized molds. These recipes produce too much for a single mold unit. It would have been nice if they used a matrix for the ingredients like on a box of rice. I am just math lazy and bought a single mold Zoku. Dividing 3/4 of a cup, 3 tablespoons or 3 1/2 tablespoons is kind of dicey in my kitchen.,home
I bought this when I bought the pop maker. I think the recipes are fine, but there really isn't much in the book I wouldn't have figured out myself.A couple of good creamy recipes that are now available for free on recipe websites. As for "pop embellishing" well, that wasn't too hard to figure out, either. I'd save the money and spend it instead on extra pop sticks, which seem to disappear the way socks do....,home
The Zoku accessories are pricey, but the recipes have the exact amount you need to make the pops.  I have made it through 15 varieties so far, and I like them all.,home
High quality book. Clear and helpful information, and then some superb recipe suggestions clearly outlined. I can highly recommend this product.,home
I purchased the Trilogy with hoping my two cats, age 3 and 5 would be interested.  The 3 yr old cat was fascinated for about 15 minutes but when the same pictures came on, she got bored.  The 5 year old watched for about a few minutes but then walked away. It is possible that because we have a wonderful courtyard full of greenery and trees and one of my neighbors has a bird feeder, that there is enough going on outside that they prefer real life versus a taped version.  I will more than likely pass this on to a friend who has cats that don't have as much wildlife to watch as mine do.,pets
There are usually one or more of my cats watching TV and staying out of trouble when this DVD is playing.  They seem to like the mice and birds the most and maybe go a little less stir crazy being inside all the time.,pets
I bought the triliogy and have tested out all the DVDs.  It appears that volume 2 is the most well received of the three and the one I would recommend.  It's funny to watch my cat watch it bc she looks behind the TV trying to find the birds.  I turn this on sometimes when I'm leaving the house, by the time I get home, she doesn't seem to be paying attention anymore but figured she'd at least enjoy the sounds.,pets
My female kitty could care less about these videos-but she cares less about almost everything. My little male however digs these. He doesn't go ape over them, but he really does watch them for a bit and it makes me feel better to throw them on when I have to go out to work and leave him.,pets
If I had gotten just volume two, I would have given it five stars, but since I got the trilogy, I can only give it three stars.  I read all the reviews, and knew that vol. two was the best, hands down, but for few extra dollars I decided to get all three in a combo pack.  Since birds are a natural source of food for cats (feral) it was natural that they were instantly attracted to vol. two. Contrary to all the cartoons, cats are not fishermen, and thus, fish, either in a bowl or in the wild are not something they are naturally attracted to. Since gerbils and guinea pigs are not native where I live, they could have been little dogs as far as my cats could tell. Rodents are also a natural food, so volume one was much better than volume three. Also, the quality could have been better (for my eyes only) but my cats could care less about video quality... they just see birds..  LOL,pets
My Rottie has food allergies to poultry, beef and dairy. I've had a difficult time finding a toothpaste that doesn't make him allergic and he enjoys the taste. This toothpaste is peanut flavor (smells like black licorice). He loves the taste and doesn't wiggle as much when I brush his teeth every night. The price is ok, but I do wish that the tube came in a larger size. Soooo, if your pup has allergies or doesn't like his/her current toothpaste you might want to try this one.,pets
My puppy loves this stuff! His tail starts wagging as soon as I ask him if he's ready to brush his teeth! It is actually an enjoyable daily experience! Definitely my &#34;Go To&#34; dog toothpaste.,pets
My toy poodle loves this stuff and will let me &#34;sort&#34; of brush her teeth because of it.  I was hoping it would help with her doggy breath and it does some.  Interestingly... it says &#34;peanutbutter&#34; but it doesn't smell like peanutbutter.,pets
Works great and dog doesn't hate the taste.  Gum health is important so just have to brush those pearly whites.,pets
Yes , my Princess is enjoying the taste showing that She is getting best/top results .. She loves that and me too ... Strongly recommended , without regret ...,pets
This is a great tutu and at a really great price. It doesn't look cheap at all. I'm so glad I looked on Amazon and found such an affordable tutu that isn't made poorly. A++,clothing
I bought this for my 4 yr old daughter for dance class, she wore it today for the first time and the teacher thought it was adorable. I bought this to go with a light blue long sleeve leotard and was happy the colors matched up great. Price was very good too since some of these go for over $15.00 dollars.,clothing
What can I say... my daughters have it in orange, black, white and pink and I am thinking to buy for they the fuccia one. It is a very good way for exalt a dancer outfit: great colors, comfortable, looks great, easy to wear, durables and little girls love it. I think it is a great buy for costumer and play too.,clothing
We bought several tutus at once, and they are got high reviews. Sturdy and seemingly well-made. The girls have been wearing them regularly, including out to play, and the tutus have stood up well. Fits the 3-yr old & the 5-yr old well. Clearly plenty of room to grow. Only con is that when the kids pull off the tutus, the waste band gets twisted, and an adult has to un-tangle. But this is not difficult.,clothing
Thank you Halo Heaven great product for Little Girls.  My Great Grand Daughters Love these Tutu's.  Will buy more from this seller.  Made well and cute on the girls.  Thanks for a great product.NEVER BUY FROM DRESS UP DREAMS........I will buy more as long as I don't buy from &#34;Dress Up Dreams&#34;  I never rec'd or order in FL. Only rec'd pink, the purple one was missing.  Company is a rip off.  REFUSES to make good on purchase...... Real creeps.,clothing
I received this today and I'm not a fan of it but my daughter is I thought it would be puffier as it looks in the pic but it's not and the one they sent me is pink underneath and the waist band is pink which is not what I wanted due to the fact she already had the sandals she was gonna wear with it now I gotta find another pair of sandals,ima just keep it cuz she likes it.,clothing
Bought this as a backup to the regular ballet outfit my daughter has to wear. So far, she's using it to play out her Cinderella dreams but I am sure we'll be able to use it for a recital sometime soon. The quality is just fine for the price we paid. I was not expecting a designer skirt for this price and got exactly what I paid for.,clothing
Great tutu for a great price. It isn't a &#34;full&#34; or high quality skirt, but it is perfect for my daughter to wear over leggings for her little outfits.,clothing
My daughter liked this, and it with her costume, but she would have liked it to be a bit fuller.,clothing
For what I paid for two tutus is unbeatable anywhere!  I ordered a pink and turquios and they are vibrant and beautiful! The tutu is very full! Princess style! Not cheaply made! Not cheap materia! Obviously someone made these with love and care! I paid less than 7 bucks for a tutu I and I feel proud of my self for researching to the point of finding gold!Recommend 2-6 years!My daughter is two ! Wears size 4t and this skirt ( one size ) fit perfect and will probaly be able to accommodate her quickly growing waist for some time!,clothing
I like the item pricing. My granddaughter wanted to mark on it but I wanted it just for the letters.,toys
Love the magnet easel... great for moving to different areas... Wish it had some sort of non skid pad on bottom though...,toys
Both sides are magnetic.  A real plus when you're entertaining more than one child.  The four-year old can find the letters for the words, while the two-year old can find the pictures the words spell.  (I bought letters and magnetic pictures to go with this board).  Both grandkids liked it a lot, which means I like it a lot as well.  Have not even introduced markers, as this will be used strictly as a magnetic board.,toys
Bought one a few years ago for my daughter and she loves it, still using it today. For the holidays we bought one for our niece and she loved it too.,toys
I have a stainless steel refrigerator therefore there are not much space for my son to play with his magnet. Brought this for him to put his magnet on. He enjoys sticking his magnet on it. Great to have so he can play with his alphabet magnets.,toys
this is a nice magnetic board for the kids to carry around and play with the letter bought additional magnetic pieces from mellissa and doug to increase thier play time with them hope it works,toys
This is just as I expected. It's not too sturdy but it stands up well. I'm not sure how long it will last, but my grandsons love plalying with it.,toys
My granddaughter really really likes this. I love that you can just fold it up and put it away. Would definately recommend.,toys
This is good product to have with unlimited possibilities. I also ordered the magnetic letters & numbers by Melissa & Doug.  The dry erase has to be erased quickly or they tend to leave marks. Also, the magnet is not very strong. It's a nice size & works very well for our needs.,toys
I keep this board on top of the hallway table so that I can quickly write notes (which won't get lost until I erase them) and it folds down neatly so it's easy to hide when company calls.  I also like the size -- not too big and not too small.  Quality magnets hold pretty good but I use it mainly for notes. NOTE:  Children's alphabet letters don't hold very well - they tend to slide.,toys
